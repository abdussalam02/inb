"""Module `linkedinconnect.py` serves as a interface between the user and
the LinkedIn's `MyNetwork` page.  It allows the user to send invitations to
the people in the `MyNetwork` page.

The `linkedinconnect.py` module is a wrapper around the `selenium` module
and in some places it is an extension to the `selenium` module.

  * `selenium` module is used to interact with the `MyNetwork` page.

You can directly use the following class to interact with the `MyNetwork` page:

  * `LinkedInConnect`

  ```python
  # Initializing the `LinkedInConnect` class.
  linkedinconnect = connect.LinkedInConnect(max_connection_limit=limit)

  # Get the `MyNetwork` page.
  linkedinconnect.get_my_network_page()

  # Send invitation requests to people.
  linkedinconnect.send_connection_requests()
  ```
