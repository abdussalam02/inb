**inb** is an automation tool for LinkedIn that allows users to automate various tasks, such as sending connection requests, messaging connections, and endorsing skills. With **inb**, users can save time and streamline their LinkedIn outreach efforts.

The tool is written in Python and uses the **LinkedIn Voyager API** to interact with LinkedIn.

**inb** is designed for professionals who want to expand their network and increase their visibility on LinkedIn. It can be used for personal or business purposes, and is ideal for individuals who want to grow their network without spending hours manually sending connection requests and messages.

The tool is open source and available on GitHub, so users can contribute to the development of the project and customize it to their specific needs. To get started, simply download the tool from GitHub and follow the instructions in the **`README`** file.

> No **"official"** API access required - Just use a valid LinkedIn account!
